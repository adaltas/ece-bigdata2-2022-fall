## Experiment tracking

**Objectives:**

- Demonstrate how experiment tracking helps with linking the code, the results and the environment details.
- Note how this increases the reproducibility.

**Dependencies:**

- notebook: `wine_linear_regression.ipynb`

**Instructions:**

1. Install `mlflow` to your cluster: `%pip install mlflow`.
2. Modify the notebook to log the model parameters and metrics with mlflow.
3. Explore the mlflow dashboard.
4. Think how you need to design your dashboard to make your experiments reproducible and meaningful.
